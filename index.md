Interactive motion generation on Softbank robotics pepper robot using Playful: Softbank robotics personal emotional robot pepper is one of the most widely used commercially available humanoids with more than 2000 institutions rendering its service and 10000 units sold. The robot is used as the poster child for robotics in many articles and documentaries for example in the recent presentation at the British Parliament. However even with a high level API as Naoqi supplied by the manufacturer the robot in many occasions is used only for scripted behaviour and voice recognition interactions. With this project we develop a new supplementary API with an additional reactive motion generation component. The new API supports the user in creating robust and complex reactive behaviours with the robot.<br/>

##My Projects

▪   Master Thesis: Interactive motion generation on Softbank robotics pepper using Playful. Created a new API for the robot that enables reactive behaviour generation on the robot. The project will be released with an open source license in due time. https://playful.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/<br/>
▪   Project (Masters): Energy efficient path planning of a hybrid UAV using ROS Gazebo, Octomap and A* Path Planning Algorithm<br/>
▪   Colour sorter and a line following robot using MatLab Simulink and Lego Mindstorms<br/>
▪   Balancing platform using SciLab, FreeRTOS and Atmel Microcontroller<br/>
▪   Design of a Iris Scanner using Zybo, Xilinux FPGA<br/>
▪   Was involved in the development of 19 automated shoulder strap making machine which would full automate the shoulder strap production for bras. Upgraded the drawings and the design and managed the project adhering to timelines and supervised fabrication and installation.<br/>
▪   Designed a Fabric Bonding machine with lower cost and with the required unique requirement for production<br/>
▪   Re designed a Fabric Molding machine to cater larger molds as a requirement by a customer. Wrote the cost effective firmware for the machine using Arduino<br/>
▪   Designed a machine and wrote the firmware using PIC for a shoulder strap Measuring Unit for the purpose of dispensing the correct quantity from the RM stores<br/>
▪   Created a low cost efficient Performance Monitor for the use of data collection and performance monitoring of machine operators using raspberry pi and python<br/>
▪   Designed a fabric relaxing and dispensing unit for the Fabric Inspection department.<br/>
▪   Developed a smart automated chopper for the sewing process by tapping into the machine from outside circuitry using a pic microcontroller and a fibre optic sensor<br/>
▪   Designed a machine that would combine two operations of edge clearance and bar tacking<br/>
▪   Designed an automated bra underwire insertion machine<br/>
▪   Designed a machine that deskills the bra stabilizer attachment operation<br/>
▪   Bachelors Thesis – Master Slave XY axis manipulator using Arduino and TC/PIP<br/>
