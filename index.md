    Hi, I'm Lahiru Herath. I'm a Sri Lankan mechatronics master graduate. Interested in Engineering projects involving Machinery and Software development. I consider myself lazy with routine work but hard working and enthusiastic when it come to novelty and complexity. In addition i appreciate continous learning and you will see that i catch things up fast. 
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    I am a sociable individual who would get along with most people for a beer after work. However i prefer to be ethical with a Yes or No attitude even with my best friend in an professional atmosphere. I like to travel in my leisure time and have been to around 15-20 countries and lived in 3 (Sri Lanka, Thailand, Germany). As an engineer i enjoy technical work rather than managerial tasks and like to take ideas and suggestions on their merit. I've been brought up to treat every individual whatever his/her profession is with proper courtesy and consider patience and politeness as must have qualities.    
</p>

<i>Interactive motion generation on Softbank robotics pepper robot using Playful: Softbank robotics personal emotional robot pepper is one of the most widely used commercially available humanoids with more than 2000 institutions rendering its service and 10000 units sold. The robot is used as the poster child for robotics in many articles and documentaries for example in the recent presentation at the British Parliament. However even with a high level API as Naoqi supplied by the manufacturer the robot in many occasions is used only for scripted behaviour and voice recognition interactions. With this project we develop a new supplementary API with an additional reactive motion generation component. The new API supports the user in creating robust and complex reactive behaviours with the robot.</i>
